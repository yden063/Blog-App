# Blog Post Application
Simple, but multi technologies stack application that allows to write blog posts, and display them in a beautiful web page. 

## How it works ?
We have three components here : 
1. The API : Back-end
2. The database
3. The front-end

### The API
The API is public, so no authentication.
The routes and the API are made with Express.

### Database
The database used is a NoSQL database with MongoDB.

### Front-end
For the last part, I will use Vuejs.
